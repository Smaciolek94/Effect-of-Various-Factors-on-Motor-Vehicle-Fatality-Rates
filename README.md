# Effect-of-Various-Factors-on-Motor-Vehicle-Fatality-Rates
This project was done for a multivariate analysis class.  Data about all of the motor vehicle accidents that occurred in the state of Vermont in the year 2016 we obtained, and analyzed to determine which factors were significant in predicting if an accident resulted in an injury or a fatality.
